# Credit Card Transactions Report Dashboard üìä

## Introduction üéØ
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends for credit card operations. The dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor and analyze critical aspects of credit card transactions, revenue, customer demographics, and other related metrics to improve decision-making.

## Background üè¶
The Credit Card Transactions Report Dashboard aggregates data from various customer and transaction records. By using advanced data analysis techniques and visualizations, it offers a clear, concise view of credit card performance and spending behaviors. The dashboard enables users to evaluate metrics such as revenue by expense type, customer demographics, transaction patterns, and more.

## Tools I Used üõ†Ô∏è
- **SQL**: Used for querying and manipulating data from the underlying databases.
- **PostgreSQL**: Served as the database to manage and store data, especially for large transaction datasets.
- **Git and GitHub**: Version control and project management tools to collaborate, share, and track the progress of the project.
- **Power BI**: The primary tool for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## The Analysis üîç
### Key Metrics and DAX Queries
1. **Age Group**: Categorizes customers into different age ranges based on their birth date.
   ```DAX
   AgeGroup = SWITCH(
       TRUE(),
       'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 30, "20-30",
       'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 30 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 40, "30-40",
       'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 40 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 50, "40-50",
       'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 50 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 60, "50-60",
       'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 60, "60+",
       "unknown"
   ) ```
   
1. **Income group**:Income Group: Classifies customers based on their income brackets.

```DAX
Copy code
IncomeGroup = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'public cust_detail'[income] < 35000, "Low",
    'public cust_detail'[income] >= 35000 && 'public cust_detail'[income] <70000, "Med",
    'public cust_detail'[income] >= 70000, "High",
    "unknown"
)
```

3. **Weekly Revenue Calculation**:  DAX formulas to calculate revenue per week and compare it to the previous week.
```DAX
Revenue = 'public cc_detail'[annual_fees] + 'public cc_detail'[total_trans_amt] + 'public cc_detail'[interest_earned]

Current_week_Revenue = CALCULATE(
    SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]),
    FILTER(
        ALL('public cc_detail'),
        'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2]))
)

Previous_week_Revenue = CALCULATE(
    SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]),
    FILTER(
        ALL('public cc_detail'),
        'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2])-1))
```
